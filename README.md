Ballistic Penetration Calculator Versus Mediums Program

This program is designed to implement the Krupp formula to simulate fired rounds against differing mediums at differing distances.

Goals of this project are to:

1. Implement Krupp formula in C++
2. create:
   Robust system to output results of calculations for multiple ranges and targets of differing hardness.
   Formatted result output
   Ability for user to change projectile attributes such as velocity and mass
   Ability for user to change medium attributes such as depth and hardness.

3. Further Follow On Tasking:
   Implement program into Unreal Engine 5 for a visual display aid.
