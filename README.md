Ballistic Penetration Calculator Versus Mediums Program

This program is designed to implement the Krupp formula to simulate fired rounds against differing mediums at different angles of attack.

Goals of this project are to:

1. Implement Krupp formula in C++
2. create:
   Robust system to output results of calculations for multiple projectiles and targets of differing hardness.
   Formatted result output
3. Learn C++
4. Learn Microsoft Visual Studio
   
How to utilize the Program:

The program is a self guided program that is preloaded with options available to the user

Step 1: Run the program from the Ballistic Calculator Solution
Step 2: During the dialog box that pops up, type in the number corresponding to the option that you would like. 
Step 3: At any time to exit the program, press 0.
Step 4: You can find the created CSV files within the program working folder.
